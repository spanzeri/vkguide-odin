# vkguide.dev in odin-lang

This is a partial implementation of the excellent [vkguide.dev](https://vkguide.dev/) in Odin.

The project was created to learn Odin, so the code may not be idiomatic or optimal.

## Building

Tested on Linux. Run `make` to build.

## Running

The executable is located at `./bin/engine`.

## Other resources

For a comprehensive tutorial on writing Vulkan applications in Odin, see:

* [Odin VulkanGuide](https://capati.github.io/odin-vk-guide/)

I haven't looked at this project in detail, but it appears to be a complete re-write of vkguide.dev for Odin.

It includes port of libraries such as `vkbootstrap` that I have re-implemented here.
